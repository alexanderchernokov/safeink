"Can I use getID3 in my commercial program? 
The GPL is a little complicated, especially when mixing with non-GPL code. 
There is a FAQ here that may (or may not) help: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html

My interpretation of it is that if your code is only loosely tied to getID3 it 
would be considered a separate program and have no restriction on what license 
you use. For example, if getID3 sits in its own directory and your code checks 
to make sure it is there and can still work (or at least not crash, just give a 
warning like "getID3 files not found, cannot process metadata") if getID3 is 
missing, then it is a separate program. The user could download a new version of 
getID3 and upgrade that portion themselves, since it sits by itself."

Even though the we see our software as a separate program in the meaning of 
the GPL v2 license, it is not included within our archive, but require you to 
manually download that software so that - if present - the CMS may under 
special circumstances use it.
