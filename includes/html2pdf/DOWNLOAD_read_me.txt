***********************************
* HTML2PDF v4.01 and Subdreamer 3 *
***********************************

Due to the size of the HTML2PDF package, it is only available per separate 
download from this page:

http://html2pdf.fr/en/download

To use it within Subdreamer, extract the current distribution of it
to a local (temporary) folder and then upload its full contents
to this folder, i.e. /includes/html2pdf.

*** IMPORTANT: ***
All files in the folder "html2pdf/_tcpdf/fonts" having ".z" as the
file extention MUST be FTP-uploaded in "binary" mode!

The Articles plugin will auto-detect HTML2PDF once the required file 
is available here to allow the display of the PDF button in articles.
